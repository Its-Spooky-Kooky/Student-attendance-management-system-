    - Implement the spacing (4px multiples) and radius (12px, 16px, 8px, 20px) specific tokens.
    - Add the custom shadow system for both Light and Dark modes.
[ ] 4. Theme Toggling
    - Implement perfect Light/Dark Mode toggle.

    - Build Top Class Details + Timer and Bottom Progress Bar.
[ ] 8. Hybrid Attendance Capture (Logic)
    - Integrate Facial Recognition (Primary) using browser WebRTC & TensorFlow.js (or similar).
    - Implement QR Code Generation (Fallback) that regenerates per class.
    - Create the Manual Marking (Emergency) checkbox-based interface.
[ ] 9. Real-Time Sync

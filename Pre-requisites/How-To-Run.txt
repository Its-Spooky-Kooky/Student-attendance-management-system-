## HOW TO RUN THE FRONTEND LOCALLY

The frontend is completely decoupled. You can copy the `frontend` folder to any machine and run it independently.

### Step 1: Open the Frontend Folder
1. Open your terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate into the `frontend` folder:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```

### Step 2: Install Dependencies 
*If you just copied the folder to a new computer, you must install the node modules first.*
Run this command:
```bash
npm install
```

### Step 3: Start the Development Server
Run this command to start the Next.js server locally:
```bash
npm run dev
```

### Step 4: View the App Server
Open your web browser and go to:
http://localhost:3000

## HOW TO RUN THE BACKEND (Supabase Setup)

The backend is intended to be hosted on Supabase as per our technical stack. You don't "run" the backend locally like the frontend right now, but you will need to set up Supabase and link it to the frontend via Environment Variables.

### Setup Instructions
1. Go to https://supabase.com/ and create a free account/project.
2. Get your **Project URL** and **Anon API Key** from the Project Settings -> API.
3. In your `frontend` folder, create a new file called `.env.local`.
4. Add the Supabase credentials to the file:
   ```env
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_project_url_here
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_anon_api_key_here
   ```

*(Later, if we move to a custom Node.js/NestJS backend, these instructions will be updated to include commands like `npm run start` in the `backend` folder).*

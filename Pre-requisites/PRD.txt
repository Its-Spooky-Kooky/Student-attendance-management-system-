- Proxy attendance (friends marking for absent students) remains a persistent issue
- Lack of real-time insights for early intervention on at-risk students
- No automated parent communication on attendance irregularities
- Difficulty in compliance reporting for AICTE and other regulatory bodies

### Target Users
- **Primary:** Teachers, Faculty, Department Heads
- **Secondary:** College Administrators, Principals, HODs
- **Tertiary:** Students, Parents/Guardians

### Product Goal
Enable institutions to achieve 95%+ attendance accuracy with <2 minute class startup time while maintaining full compliance with regulatory requirements.
